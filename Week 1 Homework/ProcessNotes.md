This was really hard since I have never used Processing, p5.js, or openFrameworks before. 
I prefer to use Python, which isn't great for graphics, and I never use Python to do graphics work. 

My recreations are alarmingly simple as a result, and inexact. 

I had to start small and simple, and my method was to try it first in Python, and see if I could then do it in p5.js.
