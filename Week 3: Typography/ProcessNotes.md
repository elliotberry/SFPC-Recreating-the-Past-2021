I endeavored to recreate some pages of N. H. Pritchard's _EECCHHOOEESS_. 
Pritchard's work isn't especially typographically "fancy" or complicated, 
but working with Black writers and artists is in keeping with my social
and computational commmitments. 

I would like to do more recreations of his work, but only had the time 
to do a creation of his page of 1s, and the "FROG" poem. 

Both were done in p5.js. Zach Lieberman was helpful in structuring
the FOR loops in the page of 1s.
